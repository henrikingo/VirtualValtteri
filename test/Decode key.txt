Key for second column codes

tn = Time neutral (yellow color)
ti = Time improved (green color) = Best time for this driver in this session
tb = Time best (purple color) = Best time for anyone in this session (implies P1)
ib = individual best (white color) = at end of session, best times for each sector and total for this driver. For lap times sent also during session.
in = individual neutral. Appears in columns c2,c11 and c10 which are <unknown>, Lap and lap time or gap, respectively

The above are sent as text strings, with decimal dot, such as 45.123

*i1 = sector 1, integer. Example: r17692|*i1|18150
* = lap time and sector 2. Example: r17692|*|43527|25377

Note that these are sent as integer milliseconds, no decimal, such as 45123

# = position, integer
in without any additional data = When car comes into the track at beginning of session. Example: r17692c2|in|



These are used for c1, there's never any additional data. I think these might be the up/down arrows when position changes?
gf
gl
gm
gs  


These are used for c2, no additional data.

These are even rarer and not attached to a specific driver
